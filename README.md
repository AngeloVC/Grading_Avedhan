Grading Avedhan
Description:
Grading Avedhan is a grading application developed in Python. 
This project was developed as my Class 12 computer science project in 2022 and allows users to manage student grades for various subjects and perform operations such as inserting, modifying, and deleting data in a MySQL database.

Features:

Insert student data and grades into the database
Modify student name, subject, marks, and grade
Delete student records from the database
Display the table of student records from the database

How to Use:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies, including mysql.connector.
Ensure that you have a MySQL database set up with the appropriate table structure (results table).
Modify the database connection settings in the code (host, user, password, database).
Run the Python script grading_avedhan.py.
Follow the on-screen instructions to use the application.

Usage:

To insert student data: Select option 'A' and follow the prompts to enter student name, subjects, and marks.
To display the table of student records: Select option 'B' to view all records in the database.
To delete student records: Select option 'C' and enter the student name and subject to be deleted.
To modify student data: Select option 'D' and choose the attribute (name, subject, marks, grade) to modify.
Note: The application requires a password ('user1') to access its functionalities. Change this password for security reasons before deployment.
